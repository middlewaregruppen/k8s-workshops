🏠 [Home](/workshops/preparations/README.md)

These are the tools we'll be using throughout the chapters. Some might be use in a chapter later but we'll go ahead and install them anyway. Just to get it out of the way.

* [kubectl](./install-client-tools/01-install-kubectl.md) - Manages kubernetes clusters
* [kind](./install-client-tools/02-install-kind.md) - A tool for running local Kubernetes clusters
* [kustomize](./install-client-tools/03-install-kustomize.md) - Template-free application configuration
* [kube-score](./install-client-tools/04-install-kube-score.md) - Static code analysis of Kubernetes resources
