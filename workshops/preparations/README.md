Before we can actually install Kubernetes we must first make sure that our environment is prepared for it. After this chapter your computer should be ready to both install and work with a cluster. These are the things that we'll go through here:

1. [Installing Docker](/workshops/preparations/01-install-docker.md)
2. [Installing client tools](/workshops/preparations/02-install-client-tools.md)
3. [Installing a cluster](/workshops/preparations/03-creating-cluster.md)
4. [Deploying an Ingress Controller](/workshops/preparations/04-deploying-ingress-controller.md)
5. [Deploying a load balancer](/workshops/preparations/05-deploying-loadbalancer.md)
